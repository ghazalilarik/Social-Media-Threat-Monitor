# Social-Media-Threat-Monitor
This Social Media Threat Monitor is a tool that continuously monitors social media channels such as Twitter and Reddit for mentions of data breaches, cyber threats, or vulnerabilities. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to categorize the types of threats and provides a mechanism for ongoing monitoring.
